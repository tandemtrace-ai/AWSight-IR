# AWSight-IR

AWSight-IR leverages AWS native services and APIs to maintain fast visibility of your cloud infrastructure while providing powerful incident response capabilities using AI. 
Adversaries use the same APIs and methods as administrators and developers, and so context would make a difference in classifying bad actors. 


## ðŸš€ What This Project Does


This proof-of-concept shows how to automate AWS context retrieval for IR and SecOps use casesâ€”with AI-ready integration.



## How?

 - âœ… Uploads a Lambda function ZIP file to S3
 - âœ… Deploys the necessary AWS infrastructure using CloudFormation.
 - âœ… Invokes the Lambda function to fetch critical security data.
 - âœ… Retrieves and processes the latest IR data from S3.
 - âœ… Cleans up AWS resources automatically post-execution. 

ðŸ¤“ðŸ”Ž Start working with your context 



## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

Adversaries use the same APIs and methods as administrators and developers, and so context would make a difference in classifying bad actors. 

 - ðŸ”¹ Speed Matters â†’ We need context mapping in seconds, not minutes or hours.
 - ðŸ”¹ AI as a Force Multiplier â†’ Any AI API can work with this, even DeepSeek :-) 
 - ðŸ”¹ Scalability â†’ Works across small and large AWS environments.
 - ðŸ”¹ Automation & Integration â†’ No more manual queryingâ€”let serverless do the work.



Cybersecurity is fundamentally a data challenge. Attackers move fast, but defenders can move faster.
