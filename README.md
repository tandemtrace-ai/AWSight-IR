# AWSight-IR

### AWSight-IR leverages AWS native services and APIs to maintain fast visibility of your cloud infrastructure while providing powerful incident response capabilities using AI. 

🚀 What This Project Does

This proof-of-concept shows how to automate AWS context retrieval for IR and SecOps use cases—with AI-ready integration.

How?

✅ Uploads a Lambda function ZIP file to S3
✅ Deploys the necessary AWS infrastructure using CloudFormation.
✅ Invokes the Lambda function to fetch critical security data.
✅ Retrieves and processes the latest IR data from S3.
✅ Cleans up AWS resources automatically post-execution. 

🤓🔎 Start working with your context 

💡 Why This Matters

Adversaries use the same APIs and methods as administrators and developers, and so context would make a difference in classifying bad actors. 
🔹 Speed Matters → We need context mapping in seconds, not minutes or hours.
🔹 AI as a Force Multiplier → Any AI API can work with this, even DeepSeek :-) 
🔹 Scalability → Works across small and large AWS environments.
🔹 Automation & Integration → No more manual querying—let serverless do the work.
